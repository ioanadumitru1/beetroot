          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Aspiring software developer. My journey into programming began with
            formal education in Computer Science, where I developed a solid
            understanding of coding principles, and continued through a recent
            UI/UX design course and self-study & personal projects. Teaching
            coding to kids has further deepened my technical knowledge and
            communication skills. Eager to leverage my skills in real-world
            applications, I am looking forward to contributing to dynamic projects
            and continuing my growth in the tech industry.
